Current Implementation: v.a

General
The game is run completely on a terminal and is completely limited to "ascii art." This means that in order to not be overwhelming, the graphics should be fundamentally simple.

Without doing any research here are some ideas on how to achieve simplicity:
    don't clutter the screen with lots of different characters
    try to be as spacious as possible
    if there's text make sure to use a standard signifier
        - like some sort of a box or something
