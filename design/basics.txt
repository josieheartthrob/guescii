The user must try to guess a sequence of letters.
The sequence stays the same for a single game but is randomized for each game.
A hint is given to the user with each guess.
    The amount of letters in the guess that are in the same exact place as the
            answer and the amount of letters that are in the guess but not in the same place as the answer (excluding the exact guesses) are displayed to the user.
The user has a distinct amount of attempts to guess the answer before they lose
        the game.

The user has the option to change the amount of attempts they're given; the
        amount of letters a guess is composed of; and the pool of letters the
        guess chooses from when being built.
When the user first runs the game they're given a variety of options: to start a
        new game; change the settings; or quit the game
When the user is playing the game - in addition to guessing the combination:
        they have the option to quit the game or return to the menu.
If the user is at the menu and there's a game still in progress, they have the
        option to continue that game
